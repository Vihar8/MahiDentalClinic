      description:
        "Braces are more than just a beauty boost. They address various issues—open bite, jaw structure, and overcrowding—ensuring proper oral health. Straightened teeth mean improved hygiene, efficient chewing, and reduced periodontal problems. Clear aligners, a popular option, are virtually invisible and perfect for adults seeking discreet orthodontic treatment. No food restrictions, no speech difficulties—just comfort and hygiene, offering confident smiles for all.",

      title: "Wearing Aligners",
      description:
        "When you wear clear aligners, you can smile without it being obvious that you are undergoing orthodontic treatment. What will be obvious is that your smile is looking better. Since the aligners are clear, you can see the position of your teeth. This is a huge benefit because as your teeth become straighter, your appearance will improve, rather than you waiting until the very end to benefit from the changes.",

      description:
        "The temporomandibular joint is the pivot joint that hooks up the lower jaw with the skull’s temporal bone. These joints regulate jaw movement. The jaw can smoothly make up-down and side to side movements along with enabling a person to chew, yawn or talk. There are muscles around the jaw joint too. These muscles control jaw position and movement.",
